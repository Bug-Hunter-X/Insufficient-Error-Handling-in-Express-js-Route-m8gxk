# Insufficient Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers. The `bug.js` file showcases a route that neglects to handle errors properly, resulting in generic and unhelpful error messages. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling.  A database error, for example, might produce a generic 500 error, making debugging difficult. Specific error types should be caught and responded to appropriately for improved user experience and maintainability.

## Solution

The solution implements more comprehensive error handling.  It differentiates between various error types (e.g., database errors, user input errors) and returns specific, informative HTTP status codes and error messages.
